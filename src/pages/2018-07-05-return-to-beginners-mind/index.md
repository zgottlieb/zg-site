title: "Return to Beginner's Mind"

Six weeks ago, I started attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-guided programmer's retreat based in New York City. I had been wanting to attend RC since I first heard about it in 2012, and this spring I finally felt like I was in the right position to attend.

For most of the past year, I worked as a Team Lead at a growing startup company in New York City. Prior to that I was the main front-end developer at that same company. In my new role, I tried to stay involved in the code as much as I could, but I found myself spending the majority of my time on non-technical matters. There's a lot more I want to learn and build as a programmer, so I knew I needed to get back to writing code. No doubt, the Recurse Center was the perfect opportunity to press the reset button and get to it.

On the first day of my batch, the founders gave an opening address in which they expressed that the primary intent for RC is to give people the resources to become "dramatically better" programmers. This may seem like an obvious goal for anyone at a programming retreat, but it isn't so clear when there is no real agenda or curriculum to follow. With many different paths to take, success can take many forms.

The emphasis on exploration and experimentation as a central part of learning at RC has gotten me thinking about the Zen Buddhist concept of [shoshin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin), which roughly translates to "beginner's mind." In the book _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_, author and Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki notes that "in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few." The idea is that throughout the process of learning and developing expertise, we develop preconceived notions that may alter how we approach new endeavors, or whether or not we take on new endeavors at all. But when we return to our beginner's mind, we tend to be more mentally and psychically prepared for the unknown challenges that lie ahead.

I find the concept of "beginner's mind" to be an incredibly valuable reminder for how I can reshape my approach to RC and my programming career as a whole. In choosing what to focus on at RC, I have already experienced some doubts about whether I'm focusing on the "right" thing or doing things the "right" way. I came in thinking that my experience at RC should have a specific end goal, some grand project that I'd finish in the final weeks of my batch and be able to show off as "proof" of my newfound knowledge. 

Instead, I want to return my beginner's mind and become more comfortable with the struggle that comes with learning complex concepts and new skills (in my case, that is learning Rust and programming concepts that I didn't encounter as a front-end developer). Late-night battles with the compiler; diligently tracing state through your program to catch bugs; throwing together little experiments in your code to check your understanding of a language or library; admitting to programmer friends that you're stuck or don't grok some new concept &mdash; none of these are glamourous, but they are all necessary and common stops on the path towards becoming a better programmer. 

For me, this starts with changing my fundamental approach to learning. The path ahead is long and filled with challenges, and I feel that best way to face those challenges and the fear of the unknown is to approach it all with a beginner's mind.

Onwards!
