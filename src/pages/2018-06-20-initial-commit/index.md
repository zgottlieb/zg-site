Hi there. Welcome to my blog. I've been wanting to get a blog going for a while now. I am taking a sabbatical this summer to attend the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), and so this feels like the perfect time to get started.

There is no immediate goal for this blog other than to share thoughts and experiences that may or may not be interesting, useful, or entertaining to other people. Many posts will revolve around technical things &mdash; I am a programmer after all &mdash; but I anticipate writing about a variety of things from travel to music to science to general musings about the world. Let's see where it goes.
