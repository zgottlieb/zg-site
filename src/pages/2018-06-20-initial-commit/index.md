Hi there. Welcome to my blog. I've been wanting to get a blog going for a while now, and this summer, during which I am taking a break from full-time work to attend the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), feels like the perfect time.

There is no immediate goal for this blog other than to share thoughts and experiences of mine that may or may not be interesting, useful, or entertaining to other people. Most posts will revolve around technical things &mdash; I am a programmer after all &mdash; but I my interests are wide-ranging, so I anticipate writing about a variety of things. Let's see where it goes.
